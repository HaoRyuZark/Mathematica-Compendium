\section{Important Theorems of Single Variable Calculus}

\subsection{Intermediate Value Theorem}

Let \( f \) be a continuous function on the closed interval \([a, b]\). If \( f(a) \ne f(b) \) and \( N \) is any number between \( f(a) \) and \( f(b) \), then there exists \( c \in (a, b) \) such that \( f(c) = N \).

\textbf{Proof:}  

Without loss of generality, assume \( f(a) < N < f(b) \).  
Define:
\[
S = \{ x \in [a, b] \mid f(x) \le N \}
\]
Since \( a \in S \), \( S \) is non-empty and bounded above by \( b \). Let \( c = \sup S \).

By the continuity of \( f \), we have:
\[
\lim_{x \to c^-} f(x) = f(c) = \lim_{x \to c^+} f(x)
\]
Since \( f(x) \le N \) for all \( x < c \), and for any \( \varepsilon > 0 \), there exists \( x > c \) with \( f(x) > N \), then by the definition of supremum and continuity:
\[
f(c) = N
\]

\subsection{Extreme Value Theorem}

If \( f \) is continuous on the closed interval \([a, b] \), then \( f \) attains a maximum and a minimum value on \([a, b]\).  
That is, there exist \( c, d \in [a, b] \) such that:
\[
f(c) \le f(x) \le f(d) \quad \text{for all } x \in [a, b]
\]

\textbf{Proof:}  

Since \( f \) is continuous on the compact interval \([a, b]\), the image \( f([a, b]) \subset \mathbb{R} \) is also compact. A compact subset of \( \mathbb{R} \) is closed and bounded, and hence attains its supremum and infimum.

Therefore, there exist \( c, d \in [a, b] \) such that:
\[
f(c) = \min\{f(x): x \in [a, b]\}, \quad
f(d) = \max\{f(x): x \in [a, b]\}
\]

\[\mathfrak{QED}\]


\subsection{Rolle’s Theorem}

Let \( f \) be continuous on \([a, b] \), differentiable on \((a, b) \), and suppose \( f(a) = f(b) \).  
Then, there exists \( c \in (a, b) \) such that \( f'(c) = 0 \).

\textbf{Proof:}  

By the Extreme Value Theorem, \( f \) attains a maximum or minimum at some point \( c \in [a, b] \).

If \( c \in (a, b) \), then by Fermat’s theorem, \( f'(c) = 0 \).  
If the maximum or minimum occurs at \( a \) or \( b \), since \( f(a) = f(b) \), \( f \) must be constant, so \( f'(x) = 0 \) everywhere on \((a, b)\), and in particular for some \( c \in (a, b) \).

\[\mathfrak{QED}\]

\draw[dashed] (2.8,0) -- (2.8,3);

\end{center}



\subsection{Mean Value Theorem}

Let \( f \) be continuous on \([a, b] \) and differentiable on \((a, b) \).  
Then there exists \( c \in (a, b) \) such that:
\[
f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
\]

\textbf{Proof:}  

Define the auxiliary function:
\[
g(x) = f(x) - \left( \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} \right)(x - a)
\]

Then \( g(a) = f(a) \), \( g(b) = f(b) - m(b - a) = f(a) \Rightarrow g(a) = g(b) \)

Apply Rolle’s theorem to \( g(x) \):  
Since \( g(a) = g(b) \), and \( g \) is continuous and differentiable, there exists \( c \in (a, b) \) such that \( g'(c) = 0 \)

Then:
\[
g'(x) = f'(x) - \left( \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} \right) \Rightarrow f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
\]
