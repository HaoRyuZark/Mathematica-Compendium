\section{Introduction}

Hello, my name is Miguel, this compendium is not meant to be a complete 
guide/book about all the mathematics,
but a collection of theorems, definitions, and proofs that I have found useful in my studies.
This compendium is not a replacement for the books or the lectures at your university, but a complement to it.
On the one hand I will try to keep it as simple as possible, but sometimes there are going to be topics 
that will be quite 
complex and on the other hand some proofs will be 
skipped or not included at all, because I think that they 
are not necessary for the understanding of the topic.

My main idea while writing this was to take as much as I could from the books I have read, the lectures 
I have attended, the videos I have watched 
and the notes I have taken. This is also the reason why the order may be a bit strange, 
but I think that it is the best way to give an overview about a lot of topics and also 
via the table of contents you can
easily find what you are looking for.

The whole compendium is written in \LaTeX, so if you find any mistake, or you want to add something, please 
feel free to notify me and will make the necessary adjustments.
I will keep the compendium up to date as much as 
I can, but I am not a professional writer nor a \LaTeX\ veteran, so please be patient with me.
